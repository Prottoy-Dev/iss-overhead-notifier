# iss-overhead-notifier
This project is a combination of several elements and serves multiple purposes, making it somewhat multifaceted. It can be categorized as a Real-time ISS Tracker and Notification System with added features. Here's a breakdown of the project's primary components:

## Real-time ISS Tracking:

The code uses an external API to track the real-time position of the International Space Station (ISS).
## Day-Night Checker:

It also checks whether it is nighttime at a specified location based on sunrise and sunset times, providing a time-based condition.
## Automated Notification System:

When both conditions are met (ISS overhead and nighttime), it sends an email notification using Gmail's SMTP server.
This notification system makes it an event-driven project.
Considering these aspects, this project can be described as a Real-time ISS Tracker and Automated Notification System. It combines real-time data retrieval, location-based checks, and automated notifications to provide a unique functionality.
